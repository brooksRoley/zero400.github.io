			<h4>Three Sites: </h4>
			
			<div id="google">
				<p> <a href="http://www.google.com"><strong>GooGle! </strong></a>
					<ul>
						<li>
							This search engine honestly changed who I am as a person. I think its done a lot to change everyone and humanity as a culture, an ecosystem, and a global organism.
						</li>

						<li>
							Your eyes are drawn to the name in the center and the text bar in the dead center of the otherwise white canvas. The text bar is the most important part as thats what the user interacts with. 
						</li>

						<li>
							<ol>
								<li> Simple</li>
								<li> Concise</li>
								<li> Thematic</li>
								<li> Revolutionary</li>
								<li> Vast</li>
							</ol>
						</li>

						<li>
							It parses content to give you what you are looking for. I don't have a perfect idea of their algorithm but They give more priority on their list to sites that are linked to more throughout the web. 
						</li>

						<li>
							Very simple and very fast. 
						</li>

						<li>
							Practically impossible. I am not sure if google even counts as a website. It brings all of the other content on the internet to your fingertips so I am giving credit where distributed credit is due. 
						</li>

						<li>
							I feel educated.
						</li>

						<li>
							The company sells things but the google homepage does not sell things. It is a static service that is the heart and soul and untouched essence that drive that company and our heads. 
						</li>
					</ul>
				</p> 

			</div>

			<div id="twitch">
				<p> <a href="http://www.twitch.tv"><strong>Twitch.tv</strong></a>
					<p>
						This is one of my favorite sites because it created a subculture of gamers that I think is really interesting. It provides entertainment and strategy from the game(s) that I love. </br>
						The eye is drawn to the middle of the screen's media player. It is the main function of the site and should be the center of attention. </br>
						I would describe it as functional, fullscreen, sidebars, centralized, and relatable. </br>
						The different channels are ranked by viewership so the popular content is really easy to find from the homepage. </br>
						It is easy to browse through. </br>
						Sometimes I am convinced that it is something I want to do because I enjoy it and sometimes I feel like my time is being wasted. It is relaxing though. </br>
						The site sells ad space to companies that I have no product for. The site hosts streamers who can sell subscriptions to their channel which offer certain ammenities. I have bought nothing from the site. </br>

			<div id="euler">
				<p> 
					<a href="http://www.projecteuler.net" target="_blank"><strong>Project Euler</strong></a>
				</p>
 			
 				<p>
 					It taught me to enjoy learning on my own again. It was a lesosn I try to relearn every day. The table spanning the center of the site. It is not impressive based on visual appeal or organization. Instead, The site is a field of rabbit holes to explore accross the web. It requires a coding enviornment to be set up independantly but challenges you to learn math and programming. My five words are simple, barely interactive, informational, and confusing. It is easy to navigate and the site doesn't sell anything. I feel confused if I spend too much time on it. If I am on it for too long, it means I don't understand the question. Ha!
