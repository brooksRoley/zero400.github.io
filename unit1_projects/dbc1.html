<!-- I have to have 2 or three short paragraphs.-->
	<h3>Getting this done: </h3>
	
	<h6>
		<p>This is the about me section that I am starting. I'll fill in some pseudocode to give it structure and comments as reminders. This tells a little something about agility. That is, build small things that work then build other small things that work. Make sure it consistently works. If it always works; you'll have less stress, ignore feature creep, and debugging is easier.</p>
	</h6>
	
	<h3>Work: </h3>
	
		<p>I graduated a year ago and have spent most of the time since unemployed. For the first time in my life, I had nothing to do, nothing to learn, nothing to stop me from wasting my time with games or beers or trips or friends that I wasn't having fun with. </br> </br>
		
		I knew enough programming to know that I wanted to make a living learning every day but no knowledge of the industry or most modern technology and I was intimidated by the depth of knowledge and investment of time it would take to get skilled. </br> </br></p>

	<h3> Personal: </h3>

	<p>I play basketball and league of legends and all games, really. My favorite games are -  </br>
		<ul><em>
			<li>League Of Legends</li>
			<li>Magic the Gathering</li>
			<li>Pente</li>
			<li>Tetris</li>
			<li>Poker</li>
		</em></ul>
	 I love to climb, so if anyone wants to boulder! Lets do it. My favorite movies and books in no particular order are.... </p>
