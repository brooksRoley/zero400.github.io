		<p>This is for all of the times I ignored what was hard. This is for all of the times I wanted to be something special. This is for all of the pushups, sprints, sunday mornings, and suicides. This is to be impressive. This is to control my emotional education and increase emotional intelligence. This is all of the moments of meditation in the steam room. This is the dramatic music at the end of a really good trailer. This is the hard silence at the end of a good movie. </p>

	<!--The challenge asks to add padding and borders and margins. I thought I did that in .css? I need a lot of work spacing things with CSS. If I added text-align:center; to <p>, nothing really moves over except the bottom line. It looks better as it is but I have much to do. -->
