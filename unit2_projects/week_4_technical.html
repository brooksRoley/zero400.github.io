	<h1>Enumerable#cycle.</h1>
	<p> 
			Arrays are ordered, integer-indexed collections of any object. They start indexing at 0 and have many gloriously simple pre implemented methods. I am going to take a closer look at Array#cycle today.
	</p>

	<p>	Ruby documentation says this about cycle
	</p>

	<p>Calls the given block for each element n times or forever if nil is given.

Does nothing if a non-positive number is given or the array is empty.

Returns nil if the loop has finished without getting interrupted.

If no block is given, an Enumerator is returned instead.

</p>

<p>
How I perceive this method is that it runs through the array. You get to use a block to do whatever you want to every element of the array. What sets cycle apart is it take as a parameter the number of times you want to traverse the array. If you give it a 2 you get a double. That repeate parameter is defaulted to INFINITY! so be careful not to run an infinite loop. . .
