<h3>Release 1: Identifying Values</h3>
<p>
When I think about the happiest times in my life, I consider accomplishment, achievement, adventure, challenge, close relationships, compassion, competence, competition, confidence, control, courage, creativity, effectiveness, honesty, excellence, ispiration, romance, tranquility, and a vibrancy of truth. 
</p>

<h3>Release 2: Competition</h3>
<p>
Competition has always been a big part of my learning. My brother is a year younger than me and we would help push each other to be better. Constantly nipping on my heels and eventually diversifying and passing me up in some things. He and a few other close friends showed me I learn best when I have good competition to learn from, to help motivate, and to teach and grow with different perspectives. With vigorous competition thrives talent and success.

<h3>Release 3: Assigning values to values</h3>
<p>
There are too many relatable and overlapping values to rate each but I want to break them down into categories.
</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		<h3>Personal relationships:</h3>
		<p>Romantic, family and close friends I would rate a 4 and conformity I would rate a 2.</p>
	</li>

	<li>
		<h3>Competencies. </h3>
		<p>I am very motivated to have competencies, 5. Some skill building has to be balanced with tranquility which I also rate a 5. These see saw back and forth and should be weighted in situations. </p>
	</li>

	<li>
		<h3>Health</h3>
		<p>Having a place to workout and play basketball or other competetive games is mandatory for my happiness. I need an outlet to move and have lethargic tendencies that has recently been put on hold. I feel better healtier and faster and want to continue with exercicse and good diet.

</ul>
