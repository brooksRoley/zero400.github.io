	<h1>Stereotype Threat</h1>
	<p>

		What is it that makes a social identity? People belong to many groups in their lifetimes. Some permanent, some fleeting, some will cause laughs or go unnoticed until you find someone that doesn't fit those molds. Space time compression has minimized these ignorances but can you imagine seeing a completely new people or empire that you hadn't known exist coming over the mountain a thousand years ago. these people could conquer or benefit you in ways you had no way of knowing about because they are completely new. The current problem with stereotype threat that faces our education system refers mostly to expectations. <b>Someone that is a member of a social identity with a negative stereotype has increased anxiety when they feel aware of a possibility to propogate that stereotype.</b> Now this is the crux of the issue. It is not the lack of talent or intelligence or even training that comes into play. It is an anxiety about protecting your social identity that is under fire that means something bigger than yourself to you. This added stress often comes at the detriment of performance. When you can't help but focus on problems that are't say the problem on the page, you can't be as focused on the problem at hand and performace will suffer.

		Identity Contingencies are things you have to deal with because you have an identity. This could be things like white men can't jump, asians can't drive, old people don't know how to use technology. 
		<br>
		If you dont have to deal with things that are important to you based on an identity, then you don't place a high value on that social identity. These identities can be a part of you you just overlook and this brings shock when that person comes into conflict with a member that places high value on that social identity.It starts to be something that structures your view of the world. 
		People see themselves as the identity especially when they see it as under threat.

		When you are in a situation where your actions could reflect a negative stereotype, you feel distracted and frustrated. "Reduced to a stereotype"
		Ex: Woman in math tests.

What is a social identity? Where does it come from? What makes an individual choose a certain identity for which situation.
