	<h1>
		Explain when, why, and how to use classes
	</h1>
	<p>
		Use classes whenever you have a task. Use them often and be concise. You want each class to be an objects. Each method in that class should do one solitary thing that you won't have to rewrite. Classes are meant to model real world objects or conceptual objects. They have attributes and actions.
		<br><br>
		It is best practice to write classes with individual ideas for each method and each class. Classes should be easy to read, easy to manipulate, easy to expand on, and easy to use for others. These should be light on dependencies in the inevitable event you want to change and expand your program. It is important to work a little smarter to avoid a lot of heartache. That takes years of failure and experience and fun debugging to master but its important to know what to look for. Dependencies and abstractions come to mind. If you can avoid hard coding in favor of an abstraction, ChANGE IT! Do it now and pat yourself on the back.

		Explain how data structures and classes can model a real-world object
	</h1>
	
	<p> 
		Objects, nouns, people, places, things. They all have descriptions and something that they do. They have activity, verbs. These traits and actions can be broken and quantified. Somethings are difficult to quantify but the ability to abstract a reality and recreate a pattern like the giant chocolate bar in the original Willy Wonka seperates expert programmers. Work and knowledge and insight into the inner workings of any tool humans have ever made.
