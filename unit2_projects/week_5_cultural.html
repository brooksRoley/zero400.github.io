	<h1>Pairing</h1>
	
	<ul>

		<li>
			<h3>
				What was it like to pair with others to solve challenges?'
			</h3>
			<p>
				It was competetive and educational. I grew up with a closely aged brother and we fought and bickered and eventually competed and pushed eachother. I find solice and reprieve when I think by myself and I need to train those thought and input diversity to throwing it up against intellectuals and competetive people. I find I benefit when my teammates and opponents in anything are the most talented. I saw a lot of competition when I saw the growth mindset and I think that is in a very positive light. I want to help my friend as much or more than they help me. I want to take everything I can from those that know more.

			<h3>
				Was something particularly fun or rewarding?
			</h3>
			<p>
				Working on a problem for long enough to start getting annoyed and putting it off. I paired for 5 minutes and with fresh eyes and another's idea of organization, everything that was already there fell into working order and a few things I did't even know I knew came from my fingers. Hidden talent was fun.
			</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			Was something frustrating and difficult for you?
		</li>
		<p>
			It is hard finding times to pair with people. A few times I was very frustrated with myself when I messaged about pairing then got distracted by coding and checked back missing the person by like 20 minutes on hangouts. Most people were in the same situation and just working on stuff at home but I am frustrated when my sense of time doesn't allow me to work socially.

		<h1>Feedback</h1>

		<ul>

			<li>
				<h3> How did you feel when you read your feedback? </h3>
				<br>
				<p>I feel encouraged. Everything about this program has been a challenge. I went from unemployment being a habit to three jobs(this included) in a short while and it has been shocking and exhilerating and frightening which sometimes turns me to stone. I see a daunting task and get shy sometimes but this has people in the same situation. I always feel more comfortable working through challenges in pair because I think its fun. I like the competition and teaching and with another person to help organize I can chase the thoughts that are far ahead but sometimes run the risk of being baseless. That other person to bring me back and rubber ducky. 
				</p>

			<li>
				<h3>Was the feedback you received helpful to your learning?</h3>
				<p>A little but it was more helpful for my moral. </p>

			</li>

			<li>
				<h3>Based on the feedback you've received, what are you going to do to improve next time you pair?</h3>
				<br>
				<p>
					Pair more often. This answer is outside the frame of the question but the best practice I can get from pairing is to do it often to help stay on task. the issue isnt how I learn but the focus to maintain learning. 
				</p>
			</li>
			<br>

			<li>
				<h3>How was it to write feedback?</h3>

				<br>I had a hard time trying to have actionable feedback. I have been known to cynically sip on some hater-aid but when things are successful and people are extremely smart which is true of almost everyone I have met here, it is hard to find fault. 
			</li>
			<br>

			<li>
				<h3>What was most difficult for you when writing feedback for your pair?</h3>
				<br>
				<p>
					Being specific about a process that went very smoothly and finding actionable things for what seem like extremely effective people. 
				</p>
			</li>
			<br>

			<li>
				<h3>
					Overall, what do you think of using pairing and feedback to guide your learning?
				</h3>
				<br>
				<p>
					I have had an issue with traditional eduction my whole life with no sense of alternative. This is not perfect but it is the most effective method I have seen. It relys on personal motivation which is my biggest problem with learning but once I am in a pair, I love making a new friend with the great people that have been accepted. There are tiny things that you learn all the time that take hours and hours and hours to parse through guides from 6 different programs to find that you can find in an instant. I have seen it said that it is great for beginners if they are both beginners, faster for a beginner and slower for the expert if they pair but extremely effective for the beginner, and that experts lose some efficiency with it. As I am not an expert, this is the question that I go forward with.
